# Algorithms and Problem-Solving Patterns

This repo is my collection of core algorithm challenges and patterns learned through practice (inspired by Colt Steele's JS Masterclass).

Each folder represents a key pattern like:
- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide & Conquer
- Recursion

Each file contains:
- The problem description
- Pseudocode
- Clean solution (O(n) when possible)
- Sample test cases
