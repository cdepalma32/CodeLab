# üì¶ SQL Practice: Orders by Country

This challenge explores real-world SQL using a basic two-table schema to count total orders per country, including users with no orders. Designed and solved using **VS Code + SQLite** ‚Äî no GUI tools, just raw SQL.

---

## üß© Problem

> **Count the total number of orders placed by users in each country ‚Äî include countries where users made zero orders.**

This involves a **LEFT JOIN**, since we want to preserve users even if they didn‚Äôt place an order.

## üóÇÔ∏è Tables

### `users`

| Column  | Type    |
| ------- | ------- |
| user_id | INTEGER |
| name    | TEXT    |
| country | TEXT    |

### `orders`

| Column   | Type    |
| -------- | ------- |
| order_id | INTEGER |
| user_id  | INTEGER |
| total    | INTEGER |

## Files

- `schema_and_seed.sql` ‚Äì Creates the schema and inserts all test data
- `orders_by_country.sql` ‚Äì Query to solve the challenge
- `database.sqlite` ‚Äì Live SQLite DB (optional, may be `.gitignored`)
- `README.md` ‚Äì You're reading it!

---

## Concepts Practiced

- `LEFT JOIN` to include countries with 0 orders
- `COUNT()` with grouped aggregate
- `GROUP BY` on a parent table column
- `ORDER BY` to sort highest ‚Üí lowest

---

## Sample Output

| country | total_orders |
| ------- | ------------ |
| USA     | 3            |
| Canada  | 1            |
| Mexico  | 0            |

---

## How to Run This

1. **Open `database.sqlite` in VS Code** (using SQLite extension)
2. Run `schema_and_seed.sql`  
   _(This creates the `users` and `orders` tables and inserts data)_
3. Run `orders_by_country.sql` to see the results

## Reusability

This project is designed for repeatability:

- All schema/data is written in SQL (no GUI or exports)
- Easily swap users or countries to test other joins
- Ideal for interview prep, bootcamp review, or building a SQL portfolio

## Want More?

Try these:

- Find average order total per user
- Identify users with the highest individual order
- Count orders by country **per month** (requires added date fields)
