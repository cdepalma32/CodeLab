# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Algorithm Course

This section is a structured, hands-on walkthrough of essential algorithm patterns in JavaScript â€” built for learning, retention, and technical interview prep.

Each folder contains:

- Naive + Refactored solutions
- Clean, commented code
- Pattern-specific `README.md` files explaining:
  - Use cases
  - Time/space complexity
  - Real-world analogies

## Patterns Covered

| #   | Pattern Name             | Description                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Frequency Counter        | Compare values/characters using object maps (O(n))          |
| 2   | Multiple Pointers        | Efficient traversal from both ends of data                  |
| 3   | Sliding Window           | Track subarrays/substrings dynamically                      |
| 4   | Divide and Conquer       | Break problems down recursively                             |
| 5   | Recursion                | Use self-calling functions to solve nested logic            |
| 6   | Basic Sorting Algorithms | Understand bubble, insertion, and selection sort            |
| 7   | Searching Algorithms     | Implement linear and binary search                          |
| 8   | Set/Map/Object Lookup    | Detect duplicates, count uniques, etc.                      |
| 9   | Two Sum Variations       | Classic array sum problems with multiple approaches         |
| 10  | Palindrome Checks        | Reverse, mirror, and compare values to validate palindromes |
