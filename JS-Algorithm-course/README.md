# CODELAB

Welcome to `CODELAB` â€” a growing, hands-on personal repository designed to deepen my skills in software development, data structures, and problem solving. This space is where I break down core patterns, build reusable logic, and document what I'm learning as I grow.

## Current Focus: JavaScript Algorithm Course

This section contains my structured walkthrough of essential algorithmic patterns in JavaScript. Each folder corresponds to a major category of problems frequently tested in technical interviews.

### What's Included:
- **Naive + Refactored solutions** for each problem
- **Code comments** that explain the logic step-by-step
- **`README.md`** files per pattern to break down:
  - Pattern use cases
  - Time complexity comparison
  - Problem-solving framework
  - Real-world scenarios

## Algorithmic Patterns Covered:

| # | Pattern Name                | Description                                                  |
|---|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Frequency Counter           | Compare values/characters using object maps (O(n))          |
| 2 | Multiple Pointers           | Scan data from both ends for efficient traversal             |
| 3 | Sliding Window              | Track subarrays/substrings dynamically                      |
| 4 | Divide and Conquer         | Break problems down recursively for performance             |
| 5 | Recursion                   | Use self-calling functions to solve nested or repetitive tasks |
| 6 | Basic Sorting Algorithms    | Understand core sorting methods (bubble, insertion, etc.)    |
| 7 | Searching Algorithms        | Implement linear and binary search variants                 |
| 8 | Set/Map/Object Lookup       | Detect duplicates and track unique values                    |
| 9 | Two Sum Variations          | Classic interview problem with multiple solutions            |
|10 | Palindrome Checks           | Reverse or compare data to validate palindromes              |
