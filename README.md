# CODELAB

Welcome to `CODELAB` ‚Äî a hands-on learning lab where I actively deepen my skills in software development, problem solving, and technical interviews. This repo reflects my current focus areas and learning goals, with organized subfolders for algorithms, SQL, and more to come.

## Sections

### [JavaScript Algorithm Course](./js-algorithm-course)

A full walkthrough of foundational algorithmic patterns in JavaScript.  
Includes naive + refactored solutions, time complexity analysis, and thought process behind each technique.

- Frequency Counter, Multiple Pointers, Sliding Window, and more
- Clear breakdowns with real-world relevance
- Focused on building true fluency before speed

### [SQL Fundamentals](./sql-fundamentals)

This section documents my journey learning SQL from the ground up ‚Äî including concepts not fully covered in my bootcamp.

- Built in VS Code using SQLite (no GUI tools)
- Practice with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, and real-world schema
- Well-structured, queryable `.sqlite` databases and walkthroughs

## Why This Repo Exists

I created CODELAB to:

- Fill in knowledge gaps after bootcamp
- Practice deeply, not just copy solutions
- Build confidence walking through code, not just writing it
- Track my own learning honestly ‚Äî especially in areas like SQL and algorithms

---

## üõ† Tools + Environment

- JavaScript (Node.js for testing)
- SQLite with VS Code + SQLite extension
- Markdown and problem walkthroughs
- Manual setup (no generators or bootstraps)

---

## Upcoming Additions

- More SQL query types and real-world data questions
- Expanded algorithm patterns (recursion, trees, graphs)
- Backend debugging patterns (Express, Node, testing)

---

## For Visitors / Reviewers

Rather than rushing through 100 LeetCode questions, I‚Äôve focused on internalizing patterns ‚Äî so I can confidently apply the right approach under pressure.
If you‚Äôre here to learn too, I hope this helps you on your path!

## Feedback & Collaboration

If you see something that could be improved, extended, or if you want to collaborate on new problem sets (SQL, algorithms, etc.), feel free to:

- Open an issue or pull request
- Suggest new challenges
- Share your thoughts or refinements
